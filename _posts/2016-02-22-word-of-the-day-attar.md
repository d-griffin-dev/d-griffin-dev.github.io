In working through my delayed NYT crossword puzzle today I came across an interesting new word, _attar_ (always a good day when that happens).

A consultation of the [OED][1] tells us that an attar is "a very fragrant, volatile, essential oil obtained from the petals of the rose; fragrant essence (of roses)." The etymology is from Persian through Arabic, _ʿiṭr_ "perfume essence" and _ʿiṭr al-gul_ "essence of roses" being the base root.

Early references include ethnographies such as [Thomas Pennant's _The view of Hindoostan_ (1798–1800)][2]. [Pennant][3] was a well accomplished Welsh naturalist and writer, publishing several books on flora and fauna. The quintessential tourist.

An interesting usage is given from Thomas Hardy in his _Far from the Maddening Crowd_: "That buzz of pleasure which is the attar of applause" (I. xxiii. 263). Perfect choice of words in my estimation.
