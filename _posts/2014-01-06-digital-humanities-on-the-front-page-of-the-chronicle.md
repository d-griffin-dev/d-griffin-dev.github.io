# Digital Humanities on the front page of the Chronicle

There is an excellent article on the front page of the Chronicle of Higher Education today, ["How the Humanities Compute in the Classroom"][1], written by Marc Perry. It's an excellent snapshot of the field right now. I recommend checking it out!

I especially like the use of "blah blah blah" in this quote from Todd Presner:

> "I'm one of those people that hate the idea of, Oh, the humanities are in crisis," says Mr. Presner, a professor of Germanic languages and comparative literature. "Oh, we're so irrelevant. Oh, we're so useless, blah, blah, blah. And now technology is going to save us. I don't think that at all. I think, if anything, the humanities can save the technologies."
