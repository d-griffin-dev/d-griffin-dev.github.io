Good news, everyone! I found out today that a paper of mine, "An overlooked letter of [Diogenes] and the role of the _palaistrophylax,_" was accepted by the jury to be presented at a conference in honor of the 25th volume of _Nikephoros_, the _Journal for Sport and Culture in Antiquity_. The conference is at Karl-Franzens University of Graz, Austria, 26-28 June 2014. This will be my first trip to Austria! The conference proceedings will also be published in a volume of Nikephoros, so that is awesome too! Thanks a bunch to my dissertation writing group for providing feedback on the paper, which I wrote over the summer. Huzzah!
