A great part of my work this summer has been spent mocking up [Neatline][1] exhibits for professors, who may or may not end up using them in their courses and research. Of course, There was an [update to Neatline][2] recently (2.0), so the tutorial that Lisa and I developed for HWL is no longer up to date–Lovely! So now that Lisa is gone off to Wake Forest and I am here by myself for the upcoming year, one of the things I am going to do is retool that intro for the new version of Neatline. In the meantime, I have set up a sandbox server to play around with the new interface. You can reach it by following this link:
